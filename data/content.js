        1: "When you hear people talking about 'THE MARKET' in regards to finance, they're typically referring to the 'STOCK MARKET'.",
        2: "The STOCK MARKET is where people buy and sell 'SHARES' ('STOCKS') of companies leading to a variety of risk and reward.",
        3: "You might hear people on the news say, '... SHARES were up(or down)...' describing how THE MARKET did (or is doing) in a given time period.",
        4: "Basically, the STOCK MARKET is where you can buy tiny pieces (SHARES/STOCKS) of a company to invest your money. How well your investment does depends on how well the company does.",
        5: "The value of a company will rise and fall due to compnay or economic news.",
        6: "'BONDS' are kind of like an IOU and usually have a set payback date - which is considered to be a safer investment.",
        7: "There are also 'EXCHANGE TRADE FUNDS (ETFs)', 'DERIVATIVES', 'CURRENCIES', and other offerings, which we will learn about in later lessons.",
        8: "The stock market is where buyers ('BULLS') and sellers ('BEARS') come together to invest. You may hear the terms 'BULLISH' or 'BEARISH' market, which describes the direction the market is heading in regards to how much people are buying and/or selling stocks.",
        9: "When you purchase a STOCK, it's important to look at the 'SPREAD'. The SPREAD is the difference between the buying ('BID') and selling ('ASK') price of a STOCK.",
        10: "Think of a used car dealer making a profit on the price they quote you to buy your car (part-exchange), and the price they charge the new owner when they sell your old car.",
        11: "When referring to a STOCK, this can be described as the 'BID and ASK SPREAD'.",
        12: "The BID is how much youre willing to pay for a stock. The ASK is how much the stock holder is willing to sell the stock for.",
        13: "The difference between the BID and the ASK is what defines the SPREAD.",
        14: "Who's organizing this sale? The BROKER, and they get paid off the SPREAD. The SPREAD can also contain several other fees or costs.",
        15: "'SUPPLY' and 'DEMAND' also determine the spread. If you have a lot of sellers the SPREAD can widen (high SUPPLY and low DEMAND).",
        16: "If there are a lot of buyers, the SPREAD can be low (low SUPPLY and high DEMAND). This is why the SPREAD is always changing.",
        17: "What affects the SPREAD? Availability...how easily the SHARES of a company can be traded. Volume...if the amount of shares available is changing hands quickly. Popularity...high priced shares can have a larger SPREAD. Market volatility..good or bad news whether is about the company or the economy.",
        18: "If you're 'DAY TRADING', the BID and ASK SPREAD is very important because the difference can have a big impact on your daily 'PROFITS/GAINS'.",
