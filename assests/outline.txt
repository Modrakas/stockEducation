========== LESSONS ==========
LEVEL ONE
   .lesson
      1. What is the stock market?
         .lesson-card 
            1. When you hear people talking about "the 
               market" in regards to finance, they're typically referring to the stock market.
            2. The stock market is where people buy and  
               sell shares of companies leading to a variety of risk and reward.
            3. You might hear people on the news say, "...
               shares were up(or down)..." describing how the market did (or is doing) in a given time period.
            4. Basically, the stock market is where you can 
               buy tiny pieces of a company to invest your money. how well your investment does depends on how well the company does.
            5. The value of a company will rise and fall 
               due to compnay or economic news.
            6. Bonds are kind of like an IOU and usually 
               have a set payback date - which is considered to be a safer investment.
            7. There are also exchange traded funds (ETFs), 
               derivatives, currencies, and other offerings, which we will learn about in later lessons.
            8. The stock market is where buyers (BULLS) and 
               sellers (BEARS) come together to invest. You may hear the terms 'bullish' or 'bearish' market, which describes the direction the market is heading in regards to how much people are buying and/or selling stocks.
            9. The SPREAD is the difference between the 
               buying and selling price of a stock.
            10. Think of a used car dealer making a profit  
               on the price they quote you to buy your car (part-exchange) and the price they charge the new owner when they sell your old car.
            11. When referring to a stock, this can be 
               described as the 'BID' and 'ASK' SPREAD.
            12. The BID is how much youre willing to pay 
               for a stock for.
            13. The ASK is how much the stock holder is 
               willing to sell the stock for.
            14. the difference between the BID and the ASK  
               is the SPREAD.
            15. Who's organizing this sale? The BROKER and 
               they get paid off the SPREAD. The SPREAD can also contain several other fees or costs.
            16. Supply and demand also determine the 
               spread. If you have a lot of sellers the SPREAD can widen (high supply and low demand). 
            17. If there are a lot of buyers, the SPREAD 
               can be low (low supply and high demand). This is why the SPREAD is always changing.
            18. What affects the SPREAD? 
                  Availability - how easily the SHARES of a company can be traded. 
                  VOLUME - if the amount of shares available is changing hands quickly.
                  Popularity - high-priced shares can have a larger SPREAD
                  Market volatility - Good or bad news whether is about the company or the economy.
            19. If you're day trading, the BID and ASK 
               SPREAD is very important because the difference can have a big impact on your daily profits/gains.
